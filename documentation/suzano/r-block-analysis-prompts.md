# R-Block Analysis Documentation Prompt

This prompt is designed to help create technical documentation for the "R-Block Analysis" application in Confluence.

## Project Structure

The "R-Block" project data is located in the following folders:
- frontend/r-block-backoffice
- frontend/r-block-supplies
- suzano-eva-backend
- legacy-backend

## Documentation Reference

The documentation is based on the FUP technical documentation template, which can be found at:
https://b2rise.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/B2RISE/pages/337379/FUP+Documenta+o+t+cnica

## Documentation Approach

The documentation should be created in parts, starting with a project overview.

Always use the "FUP: Technical Documentation" model as a reference.

The documentation should be created at:
https://b2rise.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/B2RISE/pages/30179330/An+lise+de+Bloqueio+R+Documenta+o+t+cnica

## Workflow Documentation Improvement

For the "Assignment of Invoices for Analysis" workflow:
- Create a bridge between frontend and backend implementation
- Include screen captures where necessary (indicated with "<add your screen capture here>")
- Use proper code snippets formatting according to Confluence standards

## Code Formatting Requirements

Ensure proper code formatting using Confluence code snippets instead of plain text formatting.
Check the metadata of the reference page to understand how to properly implement code snippets.
